---

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-09-07
- **New:** LaraDashboard MCP server — connect Cursor, Claude, and other MCP agents to manage content, CRM, forms, email, cache, logs, and daily briefings from **Settings → MCP**.
- **New:** MCP agent tokens with ability-scoped permissions (`McpFilterHook` registry for core and module tools).
- **New:** Core MCP tools — posts, SEO meta, email templates, daily briefing, cache clear, and storage log listing.
- **Improve:** Module vendor autoload guard on Laravel 13+ (prevents stale Illuminate copies from breaking Eloquent).

## [v1.3.2] — 2026-09-06
- **New:** Dashboard widget customization — per-user show/hide for stat cards and dashboard sections via the new widget customizer panel.
- **Improve:** Lara Builder drag preview, pending-save flush, clearer save-error handling, and list block styling/reliability.
- **Fix:** `ModuleStyles` component — tighter asset scoping, broader manifest coverage, and safer module CSS loading when builds are missing.
- **Fix:** Module replace/install activation edge cases during marketplace and upload flows.
- **Fix (Security):** Marketplace Livewire install now requires Superadmin (`ModulePolicy::create`), closing unauthorized module install and auto-activation.
- **Fix (Security):** Post builder image/video uploads require `post.create` or `post.edit`; stored extensions derive from detected MIME type (blocks `.pht` and similar bypasses).
- **Fix (Security):** Manual core upgrade ZIP upload restricted to Superadmin (marketplace-driven upgrades unchanged for `settings.edit`).
- **Fix (Security):** Builder markdown fetch hardened against SSRF — git-host allowlist, private/reserved IP blocking, no redirect following, and builder permission gate on API routes.
- **Chore:** Dependency updates — `livewire/livewire` 4.3.4, `league/commonmark` 2.10.0, `browserslist` 4.28.8, `fast-uri` 3.1.7.

## [v1.3.1] — 2026-08-31
- **Fix:** Password visibility toggle — dynamic `aria-label`, `aria-pressed`, and separate hide tooltip for screen readers (#296).
- **Fix:** Mobile sidebar toggle — correct open/close icon on small screens plus `aria-label` and `aria-expanded` (#295).
- **Fix:** Fresh install migration failure when `posts.design_json` is missing — new guard migration runs before canvas padding data fix.
- **Fix:** Page canvas content-padding migration skips safely when `design_json` column is absent.
- **Improve:** Core upgrade accepts `UPGRADE_ZIP_PATH` for CI/demo upgrades from a pre-staged release ZIP.
- **Improve:** Release workflow upgrade-demo job uses the built artifact ZIP instead of downloading from marketplace.
- **Chore:** PHPStan fix in `CoreUpgradeService`; ignore `config.bat` in `.gitignore`.
- **Chore:** Synced 3 new accessibility strings (`Hide password`, `Open sidebar`, `Close sidebar`) across 31 locales.

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-08-30
- **Fix:** Hardened media uploads — SVG sanitization, server-detected MIME validation, filename sanitization, and `.htaccess` rules blocking script execution on public storage.
- **Fix:** License API now requires authentication and `module.activate` permission; low-privileged users can no longer read stored license keys.
- **Fix:** Backup restore rejects path traversal and symlink escapes in backup filenames.
- **Fix:** Media library upload modal Alpine.js `x-data` attribute quoting; restored header upload button.
- **New:** GitHub Actions release pipeline — demo deploy, auto-release on `version.json` bump, marketplace publish, and `/api/health` smoke tests.
- **New:** Headless upgrade commands (`core:upgrade`, `core:verify`, `core:snapshot`, `core:rollback`), Hostinger deploy scripts, and `module:publish-images` on deploy/upgrade.
- **Fix:** CRM and Custom Forms menu logos republish after deploy — fixes broken module icons when `public/images/modules` is gitignored.
- **Change:** Demo database refresh moved from every 15 minutes to hourly; updated popover copy across 21 locales.
- **Fix:** README star-history chart URL; demo deploy PHP 8.3 detection on Hostinger.
- **Chore:** Dependency updates (`league/commonmark`, `guzzlehttp/guzzle`, `axios`, `js-yaml`, `nanoid`, `fast-uri`, `ip-address`).

## [v1.2.2] — 2026-07-17
- **Fix:** Core upgrade no longer deletes `vendor/` in-place during the same HTTP request — new vendor is staged, validated, and swapped atomically.
- **Fix:** Post-upgrade migrations and cache clearing run in a fresh PHP CLI subprocess, preventing stale Composer autoloader failures on shared hosting (e.g. missing Livewire `ExtendedCompilerEngine.php`).
- **Improve:** Pre-upgrade backups now include the `vendor/` folder so restore fully rolls back a failed upgrade.
- **Fix:** `protect-local-files` Composer script runs via PHP for cross-platform compatibility (Windows).


## [v1.2.1] — 2026-07-15

### Lara Builder

- **Fix:** Text Editor block lifecycle stabilized — cleaner mount/unmount, reliable content persistence, and restored list markers in the canvas.
- **Fix:** List blocks preserve content when changing list type (ordered ↔ unordered).
- **New:** Native Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z undo support in the builder via history integration.

### Modules & scaffolding

- **Fix:** `module:make-crud` command and related stubs (controller, Vite, master view).
- **New:** `ModuleStyles` Blade component safely renders module Vite CSS without crashing when the build/manifest is missing.

### Dependencies

- **Chore:** Bumped `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` from 11.21.0 to 11.23.0.

### Tests

- Added/updated: `TextEditorBlockBuilderTest`, `TextEditorBlockTest`, `ModuleMakeCrudCommandTest`, `ModuleStylesComponentTest`, `BlockServiceTest`.

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-06-21

### Lara Builder — SEO & content editing

- **New:** SEO drawer in the post/page builder with live score, checklist, SERP preview, and per-field guidance (`SeoDrawer`, `seoAnalyzer.js`).
- **New:** AI “Generate SEO” action for meta title, description, keywords, Open Graph fields, and schema type.
- **New:** Advanced SEO meta persisted on posts (canonical, noindex/nofollow, schema type, OG title/description).
- **New:** Debounced auto-save for draft/pending posts once a title exists.
- **New:** Text ↔ heading block conversion in the properties sidebar (`BlockConvertSection`).
- **New:** Unified content typography tokens with CSS variables — consistent near-black defaults, inherit-by-default text/heading/list blocks, section-level text color override, and variable-based dark mode (`ContentTokens`, `content-tokens.css`).
- **Improve:** Builder header redesign — Publish / Save draft / Update actions, SEO score badge, AI content button, save status indicator.
- **Improve:** Auto-focus title field when creating a new post/page (no longer steals focus via auto-selected first block).
- **Improve:** AI Content modal — “Generate Content” moved to footer for clearer primary action.
- **Improve:** Excerpt auto-regenerates from content when cleared on save.
- **Improve:** Canvas/page settings in post properties panel (width, padding, layout styles).

### Media library & featured images

- **Fix:** Featured images no longer duplicate media files when reusing library items or sharing across posts.
- **Fix:** Posts reference library media via `featured_media_id` meta instead of copying files; legacy Spatie attachments still supported.
- **Fix:** Broken featured image URLs/thumbnails after save (legacy path + missing thumb conversion fallback).
- **Fix:** Replacing a featured image no longer deletes the previous file from the library.
- **Fix:** Post list admin thumbnails use resolved URLs with thumb → original fallback.
- **Improve:** Media picker auto-selects uploaded files (single = that file; multiple = last uploaded + all checked in multi-select).
- **Improve:** Media library index auto-selects uploaded items after reload; upload API returns normalized file payloads with URLs.
- **Fix:** Media modal broken thumbnails/truncated URLs in Select Media dialog.

### Save / publish UX

- **Fix:** Publish no longer leaves form in false “Unsaved” state or triggers leave-page reload warnings (status baseline + in-place URL update for new posts).

### Frontend SEO

- **Improve:** `seo-head` component and `SeoHelper` support builder meta, featured images, and structured data defaults.

### Tests

- Added/updated: `PostBuilderImprovementsTest`, `MediaLibraryServiceTest`, `PostBuilderServiceTest`, `MediaUploadTest`, `ContentTokensTest`, `SeoHelperTest`.
